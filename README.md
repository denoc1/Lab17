# Lab17  Nested For Loops

Write a program that uses nested for loops and the char type.

The program should ask the user for a symbol.  	

Ask the user how many rows they would like to display.

Display a diagram that has the symbols displayed in a pattern shown below:

Example.  The user enters the ‘#’ symbol and the number 5.  The output should be:
    
      #
      ##
      ### 
      #### 
      #####
Example:  The user enters the ‘&’ symbol and the number 7.  The output should be

        &
        &&
        &&&
        &&&&
        &&&&&
        &&&&&&
        &&&&&&&

Requirements 
-	Include header documentation.
-	If you use a method, include method documentation.
-	Use documentation in your code to describe the steps where necessary.

Bonus opportunities:
Bonus 1:
In ADDITION to the above, you can also have the following image printed.  Here, it is assumed that number is 7 and symbol is “&”

                  &
                 &&
                &&&
               &&&&
              &&&&&
             &&&&&&
            &&&&&&&


Bonus 2: In ADDITION to the above, you can also have the following image printed - this will only work if the number is odd.
Here, it is assumed that number is 7 and symbol is “&”

         &   
        &&&   
       &&&&&
      &&&&&&&
      &&&&&&&
       &&&&&
        &&&
         &
